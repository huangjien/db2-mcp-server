# Design Document: Read-Only DB2 MCP Server

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the design for a read-only MCP (Multi-Capability Platform) server that interacts with a DB2 database. The server will provide a set of tools for querying information from the database without allowing any modifications.

## 2. Goals

- Provide a secure, read-only interface to specific DB2 data.
- Expose database information through a defined set of MCP tools.
- Ensure robustness and reliability.
- Utilize Python 3.12, `uv` for package management, and `pytest` for testing.

## 3. Architecture

- **Server Framework:** (e.g., FastAPI, Flask) - To handle MCP requests.
- **Database Connector:** (e.g., `ibm_db_sa`, `pyodbc`) - To interact with the DB2 database.
- **MCP Tool Implementation:** Python modules defining the available read-only tools.
- **Configuration:** Mechanism for storing DB2 connection details securely.
- **Logging:** Standard logging for monitoring and debugging.

## 4. MCP Tools (Read-Only)

*(Define the specific read-only tools the server will offer. Examples below)*

- `get_table_schema`: Retrieves the schema definition for a specified table.
- `query_table_data`: Executes a predefined, safe SELECT query against a table (with parameterization to prevent injection).
- `list_tables`: Lists available tables accessible to the server's user.
- `get_database_info`: Retrieves general information about the connected DB2 database.

## 5. Security Considerations

- **Read-Only Database User:** The server will connect to DB2 using a dedicated user with strictly read-only privileges.
- **Input Validation:** All inputs to MCP tools will be rigorously validated and sanitized.
- **Query Parameterization:** Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- **Configuration Security:** Database credentials will not be hardcoded and managed securely (e.g., environment variables, secrets management).

## 6. Technology Stack

- **Language:** Python 3.12
- **Package Manager:** uv
- **Testing Framework:** pytest
- **Database:** IBM DB2
- **DB2 Driver/Connector:** TBD (e.g., `ibm_db_sa`, `pyodbc`)
- **Server Framework:** TBD (e.g., FastAPI, Flask)

## 7. Deployment

*(Outline potential deployment strategies, e.g., Docker, serverless, VM)*

## 8. Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests:** Use `pytest` to test individual components (tool logic, utility functions).
- **Integration Tests:** Test the interaction between the server framework, tool logic, and a test DB2 instance (or mock).
- **Mocking:** Use mocking libraries (e.g., `unittest.mock`) to isolate components during testing.
